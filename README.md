This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Movieflix is a open-source project that is a clone of the real Netflix. The idea of this project is to try to implement Netflix's design patterns using React and TMDB API. It is made for self learning only.

## Technologies

1. React along with all its moder features (Hooks etc)
2. TMDB API for the movie information and user authentication
3. Styling is done with styled-components librar
4. Routing is handled using react-router-dom (Version 5 using hooks)
5. Netflix style carousel is implemented with react-slick
